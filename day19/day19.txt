Completed Lessons 5 - 7 of ML_Zoomcamp by DataTalksClub.
  *Learnt about ROC Curves and implemented the model for the data set.
    *ROC - Reciever operating charechteristics
      FPR- False positive rate

      It is the ratio of false positive to the total number of actual negatives.

                 FPR = FP /TN + FP

       It is the probability of falsely rejecting a null hypothesis.
       
                 TPR = TP /FN + TP

      It is the ratio of true positive to the total number of actual positives.
      Its is also called as recall. It is the probability that the actual positive will test positive
      
      We want to minimize False Positives and False Negatives

     The ROC curves looks at all possible thresholds. It evaluates all qualities for each thresholds.
     We want the FPR to go down as fast as possible, that is we reduce the FPR so that we correctly predict the non churning ones.
    
    We want the TPR to maintain a higher accuracy rate so that we correctly predict the the actual positives.
    
 *Learnt about AUC(Area under curve) and implemented the same for the dataset.
 
 *Learnt about Cross Validation using K-fold
  Split the full train set into k =3 

    Train the model on the first two sets and evaluate it on 3rd set which is the validation set and get the AUC.

    The train and validation is divided into 67% and 33% respectively.

    Now we keep the second set 2nd set as the validation set and the 3rd and 1st one as train set and get the AUC.

    We do the same for 1st set as valid and the rest as train. Get the AUC

    These are called folds.

    Compute the mean AUC and  std auc

    STD shows how stable the model is. The scores differ against different folds.
