I spent the day learing to setup Cuda,cuDnn Toolkit for Tensorflow and Pytorch in Windows and Linux(Ubuntu Distro).
  *Learnt a lot related to linux terminal commands, dealing with errors/problems and setting up an environment for Tensorflow and Pytorch seperately.
  
 Useful resources attached in Notebook.
