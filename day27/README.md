Completed Week 2 assignment of Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Prof.Andrew.
    
    
    The assignment helped me strengthen the following topics,
    
    
          * General Architecture of the learning algorithm
          * Initializing parameters,Initializing with zeros
          * Implementing Forward and Backward propagation
          * Optimization
          * Merge all the above functions into a model
    


Completed Lessons 1-7 of Week 3 of Neural Networks and Deep Learning


      *Learnt about the following topics,
            *Neural Networks Representation
            *Computing a Neural Network's Output
            *Vectorizing Across Multiple Exercises
            *Explanation for Vectorized Implementation
            *Activaion Functions
            *Why we need a Non-Linear Activation Functions
